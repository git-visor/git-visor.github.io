# How to Use
1. Visit the web app at [Git Visor Web App](https://git-visor.github.io/web-app/)
2. You can select any sample repository with the "Select Repository" dropdown menu at the top left. Each sample repository shows a different aspect of Git. For example, the "File Deletion Example" repository demonstrates how file deletions are represented in Git.
3. You can also select the branch to visualise using the "Select Branch" dropdown menu next to it. Currently, only the "branch-sample" repository has multiple branches to choose from.
4. <a id="load-url"></a>[Optional] If you want to visualise your own Git repository, you can paste the json link generated from the [desktop app's "Export JSON"]({{baseUrl}}/contents/guide-desktop.html#export-json) into the "Load URL" input box and click "Load".

# Navigating the Graph
To understand more about what the graph represents and how to navigate it, check out the [Graph Navigation Guide]({{baseUrl}}/contents/graph-navigation.html).

# Embedding the Graph
You can embed the graph visualisation in your own website or application using an iframe. To do this, you can use the following HTML code snippet:

```html
<iframe
  id="gitvisor"
  title="Git-Visor Embed"
  src="./?embed=1&url=YOUR_GIT_REPO_JSON_URL"
  width="600"
  height="600"
  style="border:0">
</iframe>
```

The [Embedded Graph Example](http://git-visor.github.io/web-app/test-embed.html) shows an example of how the embedded graph will look like. You can replace the `src` attribute with the URL of your own Git repository JSON data to embed your own graph visualisation.
